- Pool sizing for different workloads
- Connection reuse patterns
- Monitoring connection pool stats

# =============================================================================
# Connection Pool Configuration
# =============================================================================

# The RedisConnection class manages connection pooling automatically.
# Configuration is via environment variables or constructor params:
#
# Environment variables:
#   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
#   REDIS_MAX_CONNECTIONS=10 (default)
#
# Or programmatically:
#   rc = RedisConnection(
#       host="localhost",
#       port=6379,
#       db=0,
#       max_connections=50,  # Pool size
#   )

# Example pool sizing recommendations:
# - Single agent, low throughput: 10 connections
# - Multiple agents, moderate throughput: 25-50 connections
# - High throughput, many agents: 100+ connections
# - Rule of thumb: max_connections >= concurrency * agents * 2


# =============================================================================
# High-Throughput Configuration Example
# =============================================================================

# For high-throughput applications, create a dedicated connection pool:
high_throughput_pool = RedisConnection(
    url="redis://localhost:6379/0",
    max_connections=100,
)

# Batch Operations (Pipeline)
# =============================================================================

# =============================================================================
# Best Practices
# =============================================================================

# 1. Use app.send() for most operations - it uses a shared connection pool
# 2. Use app.send_batch() or pipeline_xadd() for bulk operations
# 3. Set max_connections based on your concurrency needs
# 4. Monitor pool stats during high load
# 5. Use async context managers for dedicated connections
