StreamMachine Storage Module

This module provides a singleton Storage class for sharing state between
agents, timers, and across process boundaries.

Why multiprocessing.Manager?
    Python's multiprocessing.Manager creates a separate process that manages
    shared state. This is essential for cross-process communication when using
    agents with `processes=N`. Each worker process can read/write to Storage
    and see changes made by other processes.

    Alternative approaches and why they don't work:
    - threading.Lock: Only works within a single process
    - asyncio.Lock: Only works within a single event loop
    - multiprocessing.Value/Array: Requires predefined data types

    The Manager provides a dict() that can store arbitrary Python objects
    and a Queue() for inter-process communication.

Design Decisions:
    - Deferred manager startup: Manager is created on first use to avoid
      issues with macOS spawn multiprocessing (can't pickle at module level)
    - Per-key locking: Each key has its own asyncio.Lock, preventing
      write contention on different keys
    - Optional read locking: By default, reads don't lock (faster) but
      lock_reading=True enables read locking for strong consistency

Example:
    Within-process state sharing::

        storage = Storage()
        await storage.write("counter", 0)

        @app.agent("events")
        async def process(msg):
            count = await storage.read("counter", default=0)
            await storage.write("counter", count + 1)

    Cross-process state sharing::

        @app.agent("data", processes=4)
        async def worker(msg):
            # Each process can read/write to shared storage
            state = await storage.read("shared_state", default={})
            state[msg.key] = msg.value
            await storage.write("shared_state", state)

class Storage:
    """
    Singleton async storage manager using multiprocessing.Manager for shared state.

    Uses asyncio.Lock for per-key write protection. Thread-safe singleton pattern
    ensures only one instance exists across the application.

    Thread/Process Safety:
        - Singleton pattern uses double-checked locking with threading.Lock
        - Per-key asyncio.Lock prevents concurrent writes to same key
        - multiprocessing.Manager provides cross-process state sharing

    Memory Management:
        - shared_dict stores all values (in Manager process memory)
        - _key_locks are local to each process (Manager doesn't share Locks)
        - Call clear() to free memory when done

    Example:
        storage = Storage()
        await storage.write("key", {"data": "value"})
        value = await storage.read("key")
